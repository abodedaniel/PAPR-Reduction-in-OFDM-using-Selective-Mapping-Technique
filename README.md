# PAPR-Reduction-in-OFDM-using-Selective-Mapping-Technique
This repository contains a MATLAB code comparing a conventional OFDM implementation and a modified OFDM system that uses Selective Mapping Techniques to reduce Peak to Average Power Ratio PAPR
The OFDM implemented contains 256 subcarriers with the first 16 subcarriers carrying 64 QAM symbols.
A (Bit Error Rate) BER plot and (Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function) CCDF plot was carried out to compare the performance of the OFDM system and a single carrier system.
A modified OFDM system was designed using Selective Mapping Techniques to reduce the Peak to Average Power Ratio of the conventional OFDM system.
The CCDF plot was use to compare the modified OFDM system and the conventional OFDM system
